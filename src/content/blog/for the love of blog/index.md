I'm a very typical case in the blogging world. I've been blogging on and off since the early 2000's. At first, fully committed and incredibly excited to share my ideas with the world. A year later, can't even remember the login URL.

> Linux, going to university, movies, programming, photography, moving to a new city, moving to a new country, gardening, traveling, learning to play the piano, learning to sew, learning esperanto, baking bread... Those are some of the topics I have blogged about.

I believe the number one reason why most of my personal blogging attempts failed is because I put myself into a box. Misguided by the idea that "you need a niche", I tried to put all the things that I enjoyed in my life into tiny individual boxes. For each box, a blog.

Unfortunately, as one of those persons who is into *everything* and is always learning *something*, I am never excited about one thing long enough to keep me writing about it forever. For a person like me, [a polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath), [multipotentialite](https://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare) or [Renaissance person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotentiality), choosing one niche to blog about is as boring as it gets.


## Will this n-th attempt succeed?

If I have failed at blogging dozens of times in the past 20 years, *why* would I succeed *now*? Well, I don't know that I will succeed.

But the realization that I don't want to commit to one topic for the rest of my life, opens up the possibility of creating something more flexible. A truly personal blog that reflects my *person*. Maybe today I'm really into baking sourdough bread. Maybe tomorrow I'm really into wind-surfing. Who knows. I don't need to create a wind surfing blog to tell the world how much I love it.

I don't know why I didn't think of having everything bundled together, just like in real life, but this is the way. This will be the **One Blog to Rule Them All**.

## Learning from the past

There were two occasions where I truly loved blogging:

* I documented my move to Rio de Janeiro in my early 20s, and all the crazy things that happened while apartment hunting in the city.
* A year later, I moved to Sweden and documented my cultural shocks as a Brazilian in Scandinavia.

Both times I wrote very true to myself. I didn't care about length or expertise. I just wanted to document the absurdity of it all. So I wrote long texts, in Portuguese, full of humor. And through my writing, I made friends. Real friends, with real in-person encounters and real hugs.

I'm now 40, living with my husband and dogs in the countryside of Spain, and have a social life about 4 times a year. Is this a middle-age crisis? And is the answer to start writing about it? Maybe.

I just realized I should probably write this blog in Portuguese. My mother tongue, which I rarely speak nowadays. It's just not feasible to translate everything to both English and Portuguese (I know, because I've tried in the past!).
