## A typical case

I'm a very typical case in the blogging world. I've been blogging on and off since the early 2000's. At first, fully committed and incredibly excited to share my ideas with the world. A year later, can't even remember the login URL.

I've blogged about linux, going to university, movies, programming, photography, moving to a new city, moving to a new country, gardening, traveling, learning to play the piano, learning to sew, learning esperanto...

I believe the number one reason why most of my personal blogging attempts failed is because I put myself into a box. Misguided by the idea that "you need a niche", I tried to put all the things that I enjoyed in my life into tiny individual boxes. For each box, a blog.

Unfortunately, as one of those persons who is into *everything* and is always learning *something*, I am never excited about one thing long enough to keep me writing about it forever. For a person like me, [a polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath), [multipotentialite](https://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare) or [Renaissance person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotentiality) (and humble lol), choosing one niche to blog about is as boring as it gets.


## One Blog to Rule Them All

If I have failed at blogging dozens of times in the past 20 years, *why* would I succeed *now*? Well, I don't know that I will succeed.

But the realization that I don't want to commit to one topic for the rest of my life, opens up the possibility of creating something more flexible. A truly personal blog that reflects my *person*. Maybe today I'm really into baking sourdough bread. Maybe tomorrow I'm really into wind-surfing. Who knows. I don't need to create a wind surfing blog to tell the world how much I love it.

I don't know why I didn't think of having everything bundled together, just like in real life, but this is the way. This will be the **One Blog to Rule Them All**.
