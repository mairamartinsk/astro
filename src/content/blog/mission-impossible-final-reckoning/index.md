![Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning Movie Poster](./mifr.jpg)

Yesterday I watched [Mission Impossible: the Final Reckoning](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9603208/) in the cinemas. First off: I liked it. I don't get the negative critique the movie is getting... I mean, look... how about a quizz?

Why do we watch an action movie about secret agents saving the world?
- A) For the profound dialogues between characters;
- B) For the superb *film d'auter* photography;
- C) For the action.

Assuming you answered **C** (as you should), then this last movie in the Mission Impossible franchise is super entertaining, delivers plenty of good action; Tom Cruise's sprinting; a mind-blowing stunt or two; plenty of bombs; a touch of good humor, and a very fitting villain, perfect for this day and age: an evil A.I.
