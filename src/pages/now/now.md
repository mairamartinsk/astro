This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). It tells you about what I am currently doing, reading, watching, thinking...


## 📚 reading

Back in 2018, I decided to read all of Agatha Christie's works in chronological order. Progress has been slow. Sometimes I need a break of a couple months (or a couple years!) because I get so tired of her "formula". Other times, I get so wrapped into the plots and the characters, that I devour one book after the other, sacrificing sleep for more reading time!

- [Death comes as the End](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8310461-death-comes-as-the-end) by Agatha Christie
- [Trade Mindfully](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22576109-trade-mindfully) by Gary Dayton

## 📺 watching

- [Better Call Saul](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3032476/) Season 01
- Tickets bought for [Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9603208/)! 🍿

## 🎵 listening

Not really into any music right now, but currently obsessed with the *Peter the Great* and *The Great Northern War* series on [The Rest is History](https://open.spotify.com/show/7Cvsbcjhtur7nplC148TWy) podcast.

## ⏰ what else?

- Getting used to baking sourdough bread (I'm pretty good at yeast baking). So far, my attempts all turned into a very sticky dough and a very heavy/dense end result 🍞
- Planning a trip to Andalucía in the coming weeks 🏕️
- Slooowly going through my 120k+ personal images, which I hope to someday curate and edit 📷
- Injured my left shoulder two weeks ago and had to stop working out. Doctor requested an x-ray (which won't show anything as it's a soft tissue injury!) and the waiting list was so long, I suspect I will be fully healed before my appointment. 🏋️‍♀️
- Really excited about making fresh homemade pasta ever since buying a pasta maker  (way back in December, but the novelty has **not** worn off!) 🍝

## 💾 blog roadmap and changelog

Now that this little humble blog is up and running, I am considering a few improvements. I'm currently pushing the files via FTP to a shared web hosting, but that's not going to work in the long run.

- [x] Decided to blog again! (2025-05-19)
- [x] Setup Astro, get local environment going (2025-05-20)
- [x] Githup [repo](https://github.com/mairamartinsk/astro) (2025-05-20)
- [x] Setup a basic FTP hosting (2025-05-20)
- [x] Deploy on [netlify](https://mairamartins.netlify.app) (2025-05-21)
- [ ] Point main domain name to netlify, keep subdomains where they are.
- [ ] Look into a headless CMS?
