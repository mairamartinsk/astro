This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). It tells you about what I am currently doing (reading, watching, thinking), which is probably more interesting than knowing [about](/) where I was born or what I've done two decades ago.

## ðŸ“š Reading

Back in 2018, I decided to read all of Agatha Christie's works in chronological order. Progress has been slow. Sometimes I need a break of a couple months (or a couple years!) because I get so tired of her "formula". Other times, I get so wrapped into the plots and the characters, that I devour one book after the other, sacrificing sleep for more reading time!
