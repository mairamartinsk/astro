## 💾 blog roadmap and changelog

Now that this little humble blog is up and running, I am considering a few improvements. I'm currently pushing the files via FTP to a shared web hosting, but that's not going to work in the long run.

- [x] Decided to blog again! (2025-05-19)
- [x] Setup Astro, get local environment going (2025-05-20)
- [x] Githup [repo](https://github.com/mairamartinsk/astro) (2025-05-20)
- [x] Setup a basic FTP hosting (2025-05-20)
- [x] Deploy on [netlify](https://mairamartins.netlify.app) (2025-05-21)
- [ ] Point main domain name to netlify, keep subdomains where they are.
- [ ] Look into a headless CMS
